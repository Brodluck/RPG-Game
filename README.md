# RPG-Game

We are 2 engeniering students who are freshly starting with programming 
and this is an attempt to recreate a rpg game for the windows console in C.

Full of bugs and unnecessary lines of code, we are trying to improve 
and learn by having fun with this little project.

PS: It is in spanish, but we are planning to completely translated
it to english, or maybe our next game will be. Who knows.

Cheers
